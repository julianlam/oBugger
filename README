oBugger 0.23a Release Notes

oBugger is a fast, lean, bug tracker for developers who want a no-nonsense approach to tracking tickets.
Basic functionality is supported out-of-the-box, with additional functionality (hopefully) provided
by sets of plugins in the future.

Requirements:
	Web server with PHP5 support (i.e. Apache)
	MySQL Database

Installation:
	1.  Configure lib/config.inc.php to contain required values (public access links, local paths,
	    database servers and logins, etc)

	2.  Connect to mysql server and create a new database table (with name matching the one defined
	    in lib/config.inc.php)

	3.  Dump the base table structure into the newly created database.
		mysql -h HOSTNAME -u USERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASENAME < SQLFILE
		e.g.	If local database name is "obugger", with username "foo", password "bar", and the
			sql file in the local directory:
			mysql -h localhost -u foo -pbar obugger < obugger.sql

	4.  Test configuration by visiting new installation.
